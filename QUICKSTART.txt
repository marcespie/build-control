'build-control' is just a proof-of-concept

Assuming you've recompiled make with the associated patch,

first you start the build-control server with a rendez-vous point, .e.g,

build-control /tmp/mycontrolsocket

Then you ask for a new build, it will give you the token that goes with it:
e.g.,
0-f248894cb2237df41841c4c1 to connect  <- that's the control interface
new
1-6f53946e9ead7cac9f4e4b2d <- that's the token

you want to
export BUILDSOCKET=/tmp/mycontrolsocket
export BUILDTOKEN=1-6f53946e9ead7cac9f4e4b2d

and start your make (very important, HAS to have -j, even -j1)

Then you can control the build from the build-control server, e.g.

1:16

tells it that the FIRST build should have 16 jobs.

dump will show you the fds and the builds the controlserver has.
